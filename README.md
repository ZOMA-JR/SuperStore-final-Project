# Welcome to our data analysis project
where we explored the Superstore Sales dataset using multiple tools and techniques. This project showcases how a single dataset can be approached and analyzed in different ways across different platforms.

# Descripton
This project presents a full-cycle data analysis journey, carried out by the Visionary Analyst team. Our goal was to explore and extract insights from the Superstore dataset using various tools, each serving a unique purpose in the data analytics pipeline.

While each output stands independently, they all share a common foundation â€” the same original dataset. Each tool was chosen to highlight specific aspects of data work: modeling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
# ðŸ“Š Excel Contribution â€“ Data Cleaning & Functional Analysis (Moaz Abdulsalam)
One of our team members focused on cleaning and organizing the raw Superstore dataset using Excel. This involved:

Removing duplicates and irrelevant entries.

Standardizing column names and formats for consistency.

Applying formulas and functions to structure the data, such as IF, VLOOKUP, and conditional formatting.

Performing basic exploratory analysis to understand sales patterns and identify potential data issues before loading into other tools.

This step ensured the dataset was clean, structured, and analysis-ready for use in Power BI, Tableau, and SQL.
