# Welcome to our data analysis project
where we explored the Superstore Sales dataset using multiple tools and techniques. This project showcases how a single dataset can be approached and analyzed in different ways across different platforms.

# üîç Descripton
This project presents a full-cycle data analysis journey, carried out by the Visionary Analyst team. Our goal was to explore and extract insights from the Superstore dataset using various tools, each serving a unique purpose in the data analytics pipeline.

While each output stands independently, they all share a common foundation ‚Äî the same original dataset. Each tool was chosen to highlight specific aspects of data work: modeling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.


# üìä Excel Contribution ‚Äì Data Cleaning & Functional Analysis (Moaz Abdulsalam)
One of our team members focused on cleaning and organizing the raw Superstore dataset using Excel. This involved:

Removing duplicates and irrelevant entries.

Standardizing column names and formats for consistency.

Applying formulas and functions to structure the data, such as IF, VLOOKUP, and conditional formatting.

Performing basic exploratory analysis to understand sales patterns and identify potential data issues before loading into other tools.

This step ensured the dataset was clean, structured, and analysis-ready for use in Power BI, Tableau, and SQL.

# üêç Python Contribution ‚Äì Data Analysis & Insights Extraction by (Omnia Ashraf & Sara Elsayed)
Another member of our team used Python to perform deeper analysis and extract insights from the cleaned Superstore dataset. Their tasks included:

Loading and exploring the data using libraries like pandas .

Performing data cleaning and transformation (handling null values, renaming columns, filtering records).

Running exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in sales, profits, and shipping time.

Using visualization tool like matplotlib to uncover patterns and compare KPIs across categories.

This step helped us validate findings from other tools and provided an extra layer of analytical depth.

# üìù SQL Contribution ‚Äì Data Cleaning, Transformation & Structured Analysis By ( Sarah Mostafa & Mohamed Hazem )
One of our team members focused on utilizing SQL for structured data analysis. Their tasks included:

Data Cleaning: Performed cleaning tasks such as handling missing values and duplicates directly in the database.

Data Transformation: Transformed data using SQL queries (e.g., changing column types, merging tables, creating new calculated fields).

Filtering & Aggregation: Applied complex filters and aggregation techniques (e.g., GROUP BY, HAVING, and JOINs) to prepare data for deeper analysis.

Optimized Queries: Wrote efficient queries to extract valuable insights and ensure that the data was well-organized for further analysis in other tools.

This step helped us structure the data for a more accurate and detailed exploration

# üîó Data Model Overview (Muhammmed Hazem & Omnia Ashraf) 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/810b1c4f-8c60-466f-86db-7a5f8546ba45)


In this project, we developed a relational data model that connects key entities within the Superstore dataset. The model defines the relationships between orders, customers, products, and regions, creating a clear structure that enables efficient data exploration and analysis.

Orders: Contains transactional data, including sales, quantities, and shipping details.

Customers: Includes demographic and geographic information about each customer.

Products: Features product details like category, sub-category, and price.

Regions: Represents different geographical regions where sales are made.

This data model serves as the foundation for visualizations and deeper insights, ensuring consistency and ease of analysis across different tools




# üìä Tableau Dashboard ‚Äì Interactive Visual Insights by (Sarah Elsayed & Sarah Mostafa)
The final component of our analysis is the fully interactive Tableau dashboard, designed to provide dynamic visual insights into the Superstore dataset. This dashboard consolidates key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales trends, profit margins, customer behavior, and regional performance, allowing users to 
interact with the data in real-time.

Key features include:

Sales and Profit Trends: Visualized over time to identify patterns and seasonal fluctuations.

Customer Segmentation: Insights into different customer groups based on spending habits and demographics.

Regional Analysis: A geographical heatmap showcasing performance across various regions.

Filters and Drill-downs: Users can filter by time, product, and region, and drill down into specific details for deeper exploration.

This interactive dashboard makes the data more accessible and user-friendly, allowing stakeholders to explore insights independently and make data-driven decisions.
